# Text-Editor
A simple text editor written in C++.
Branch where instead of having all the char in a single linked list,we will try to use a linked list of single lines(basically a sandbox to test the idea).

## Installation

```bash
make
```

## Usage

```bash
./txtedit.out filename
```
